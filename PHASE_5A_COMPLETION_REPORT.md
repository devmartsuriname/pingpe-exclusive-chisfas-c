## 🔒 Security Implementation

### ✅ Key Storage
- All API keys stored in Supabase `settings` table
- Secret keys never exposed to client
- RLS policies restrict settings access to admins only
- Keys retrieved dynamically by Edge Functions

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- JWT verification enabled on both Edge Functions
- Booking ownership validated before payment processing
- Payment intent ID matched against booking record
- User can only process payments for own bookings

### ✅ Data Validation
- Required fields checked (bookingId, amount)
- Payment intent existence verified
- Stripe key configuration validated
- Amount converted to cents correctly (×100)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Unconfigured Stripe detected gracefully
- Clear user messages for configuration issues
- API errors logged and returned safely
- Unauthorized access blocked with 401 status

## 📊 Testing Readiness

### Test Mode Support
- ✅ Test/Live mode toggle in settings
- ✅ Dynamic key selection based on mode
- ✅ Metadata tracking (test_mode flag)
- ✅ Stripe test card support ready

### Error Scenarios Handled
- ✅ Stripe not configured
- ✅ Invalid API keys
- ✅ Booking not found
- ✅ Unauthorized booking access
- ✅ Payment intent mismatch
- ✅ Stripe API errors
- ✅ Network failures

### Fallback Behavior
- ✅ Pending payment mode when Stripe disabled
- ✅ Clear UI messages for unavailable payments
- ✅ Admin notification for configuration requirement
- ✅ Booking creation allowed without payment

## 🚨 Known Considerations

### Non-Blocking Items
1. **Webhook Integration** — Deferred to future phase
   - Current: Polling-based confirmation
   - Future: Real-time webhook events

2. **Client-Side Payment Form** — Not included in Phase 5A
   - Scope: Backend infrastructure only
   - Next: Stripe Elements integration in booking flow

3. **Refund Processing** — Existing refund table ready
   - Infrastructure present
   - Admin UI needs Stripe refund API integration

4. **Payment Analytics** — Data structure ready
   - Tables and tracking in place
   - Dashboard widgets to be built

### Security Warnings (Existing)
⚠️ **Unrelated to Payment Migration:**
1. Function search_path mutable (existing functions)
2. Leaked password protection disabled (Auth config)

**Action:** These are pre-existing database warnings not related to payment integration. Documented for future resolution.
